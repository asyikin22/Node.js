# INTRODUCTION

**WHAT IS NODE.JS?**
* It is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on a server outside a web browser
* We can write application on the server when it could previously only be written in web browser.
* It allows developers to write a FULL STACK application in a single language.

**HOW TO INSTALL NODE.JS?**
* We can check and see if Node.js has been installed in our computer via git bash terminal
* The shorcut keys to open bash terminal on window is 'windows' + '1' (This only applies if you have already pinned your terminal to your taskbar. 1 refer to the first position on taskbar)

* Use 'node -v' to check the installation status. The image below shows it's already in my computerðŸ˜Š

**WHAT IS REPL?**
* It is an interactive programming environment that is used to quickly test code snippets, experiment with language features and perform quickly calculations or tasks withput the need to create a separate script or file.
*   1. **Read**: Read user input
    2. **Evaluate**: Evaluate user input
    3. **Print**: print result to the console
    4. **Loop**: Loops back to beginning
 
**HOW CAN WE RUN OUR JAVASCRIPT CODE ON REPLY OR CLI?**
* It is important to familiarize ourselves with these commands in order to run our javascript code in a **REPL** environment or **CLI** (Command Line Interface)
* You can use this cool trick to open a new terminal in your VS Code without having to use GUI (Graphical User Interface - buttons, icons, menus) 'ctrl' + 'shift' + `backticks`.

**NOTE**: I will update the table from time to time as I progress further into this topic

**WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE RUNNING JAVASCRIPT CODE IN A REPLV ENVIRONMENT VS NODE.JS?**
